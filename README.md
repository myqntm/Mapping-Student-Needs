# README

Motivation: I wanted to work on a dataset that is more relevant to the work I do in the social sector. This dataset around children's needs in the new remote learning environment was not only interesting but it also coincided with the stories shared among young parents.


### Libraries Used:
Pandas
MatPlotLib

### Files Included:
analysis.ipynb - This includes all the code used to perform the analysis. 
data/raw_data.csv - This is the dataset used for this analysis. It was obtained via a download on [Data.World](https://data.world/liz-friedman/school-district-data-for-mapping-student-needs-during-covid).

### Results:
My analysis found that students in Hawaii are being severely affected by the loss in income due to the struggling tourism sector. In Alaska, students are dealing with a lack of quiet study space. Finally, Puerto Rico, Mississippi and New Mexico are the states where community hotspots and school issued laptops could have the most impact.
